This is an example of using the DotNetNuke 6.2 Services Framework from my session at Day of DotNetNuke Charlotte on June 2 2012.

The slide deck is can be found in the SlideDeck/ folder.

The master branch contains the original DNN6.2 MVC based implementation.

The WebAPI branch contains the revised DNN7.0 WebAPI based implementation.
